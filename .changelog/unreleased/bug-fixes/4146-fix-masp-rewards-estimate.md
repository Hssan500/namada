- Fixed a bug in the masp rewards estimation logic that was not correctly
  accounting for native token rewards and rewards accrued by assets shielded
  at the current epoch. Updated the API of the function to better suite some UI
  needs. Improved testing ([\#4146](https://github.com/anoma/namada/pull/4146))
